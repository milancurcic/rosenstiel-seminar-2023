## Takeaways

* Work on long and hard problems; it pays off.
* Modeling alone is insufficient; measurements are necessary.
* Laboratory and field measurements are complementary.
* Machine learning and traditional models are most powerful when used together.
* Invest time and care in open source, open data, and open research; it pays off.
