## What are we still missing?

* Waves and stress remain difficult to measure in strong winds
* We actually still have little clue how large is air-sea drag is in major hurricane-force winds.
* Models are pushed to their limits, but we still lack data.

<p class="fragment">
  $\rightarrow$ We need data in extreme conditions to be able to improve prediction models.

## Joining the SUSTAIN lab (2018)

* Can we reproduce previous laboratory results?
* What is the magnitude of air-sea drag in extreme wind conditions?
* What physical processes govern it?
* NSF: Air-Sea Momentum Transfer in Extreme Wind Conditions ($747K to U. Miami)

  $\rightarrow$ My first grant proposal ever, and awarded! üéØüçÄüéâ

## Revised Estimates of Air-Sea Drag in Strong Winds

* Reproduce pioneering lab results by Donelan et al., 2004 (GRL)
  that first discovered drag saturation in strong winds.
* Validation study before we collect measurements in extreme winds.
