* Air-sea drag is typically parameterized using a drag coefficient

$\tau = \rho C_D U_{10}^2$

## Atmosphere-ocean momentum exchange

* Air-sea momentum closure in coupled models
* Ocean surface waves are generally not resolved in models
* Wave growth and dissipation important for momentum exchange on all scales: from microscale to planetary
